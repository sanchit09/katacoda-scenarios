Docker course notes

find existing images at registry.hub.docker.com or use the command

docker search redis

1) to run docker image in background 
    docker run -d redis [by default it runs in foreground)

for specific version redis:3.2

2) List all the running containers
    docker ps

3) to inspect the current running image 
    docker inspect <friendly-name|container-id>

4) to display messages the container has written to standard error/stdout
    docker logs <friendly-name|container-id>

5) expose a port from docker container to access the application
    (redisHostPort is the name of application)
    docker run -d --name redisHostPort -p 127.0.0.1:<hostport>:<container_port>

6) Data Containers are a great way of managing configuration data which can be used by other containers. 
The volumes-from property allows us to gain access to other containers volumes which we can utilise for 
debugging or backup purposes.
